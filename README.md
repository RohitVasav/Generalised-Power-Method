# Generalised-Power-Method

The Power Iteration Method is a famous eigenvalue algorithm to find out the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix. Google uses it to calculate the PageRank of documents in their search engine, and Twitter uses it to show users recommendations of whom to follow. In this paper, I have generalised the power method to find out all eigenvalues and eigenvectors, subject to some constraints on the matrix. Further I have used this generalisation to implement an algorithm in Python to find the solution of Schr\"odinger's Wave Equation for any general bound potential.
